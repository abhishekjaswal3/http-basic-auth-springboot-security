    /**
     * Spring Boot 2.6 comes with Spring Security 5.6.x, ‚Äî the defaultsForSpringSecurity_v5_8() methods are not available in your version.
     *
     * That means you‚Äôll need to manually configure the password encoder with parameters instead of relying on the new defaults.
     *Parameter Meaning
     *
     * saltLength (16‚Äì32 bytes) ‚Üí random sequence of byte thats get added to  password before hashing.
     *
     * hashLength (32 bytes) ‚Üí length of the hash output(size of the derived key).
     *
     * parallelism (1‚Äì4) ‚Üí CPU threads used. Keep 1 for most apps unless heavy servers
     * (Parallelism defines how many threads (lanes) Argon2 uses while computing the hash).
     * How it works
     *
     * If parallelism = 1: Argon2 uses one thread (serial computation).
     *
     * If parallelism = 2: Argon2 splits the memory into 2 lanes and computes in parallel.
     *
     * Higher values mean faster hashing on multi-core CPUs but also allow attackers to
     * parallelize their cracking attempts on GPUs/ASICs.
     * {1 ‚Üí safest & most portable (always works, no assumption about CPU cores).
     *
     * 2‚Äì4 ‚Üí reasonable on servers with multiple cores (can improve performance without weakening security much).
     *
     * >4 ‚Üí usually unnecessary, doesn‚Äôt add security, may only speed things up for attackers too.}
     *
     *
     * memory (KB) ‚Üí how much RAM each hash requires. 1 << 12 = 4096 KB = 4 MB. You can increase for stronger security (e.g., 1 << 15 = 32 MB).
     *{
     * it forces both the defender (your server) and the attacker (e.g., GPU cracker) to
     * allocate significant memory for each hash attempt.
     * Typical Ranges
     *
     * 4 MB ‚Äì 32 MB ‚Üí reasonable defaults for web applications.
     *
     * 64 MB ‚Äì 256 MB ‚Üí strong security if you can afford it (e.g., admin systems, password managers).
     *
     * >1 GB ‚Üí overkill for web logins (users will notice slowness, servers will struggle).}
     *
     * iterations (>=3) ‚Üí number of iterations (time cost). Higher = slower = more secure.
     * {üîë What iterations (time cost) mean
     *
     * Iterations = how many times the algorithm repeats its internal compression/processing steps.
     *
     * Increasing iterations makes each hash take longer (CPU time) ‚Äî increasing attacker cost proportionally.
     *
     * Unlike memory, which raises RAM requirements, iterations raise time/CPU cost.
     *
     * ‚öñÔ∏è Security vs. performance
     *
     * Higher iterations ‚Üí more secure (slower to brute force).
     *
     * Higher iterations ‚Üí slower login/registration on your servers.
     *
     * Pick a number that slows attackers but keeps user-facing latency acceptable and avoids DoS risks.
     *
     * ‚úÖ Typical values for Argon2 (practical)
     *
     * 1‚Äì2: low (fast). Use for low-security or resource-constrained systems.
     *
     * 3‚Äì4: sensible default for most web apps. Good balance of security and performance.
     *
     * 5‚Äì10+: higher security (admin portals, vaults) ‚Äî only if your servers can handle it.
     *
     * In many production setups people choose 3 as a good default }

    /**
     * 1. BCryptPasswordEncoder
     *
     * Algorithm: BCrypt (adaptive hashing with built-in salt).
     *
     * Strengths:
     *
     * Widely used and trusted (default in Spring Security for years).
     *
     * Adjustable work factor (strength), making brute force harder.
     *
     * Resistant to rainbow table attacks.
     *
     * Weaknesses:
     *
     * Only CPU-hard (not memory-hard), so GPUs/ASICs can crack faster.
     *[ When we say an algorithm is memory-hard, we mean:
     *
     * ‚û°Ô∏è It requires a lot of memory (RAM) as part of its computation, not just CPU cycles.
     * Why does this matter?
     *
     * Attackers often use GPUs, ASICs, or FPGAs to crack passwords because those can compute billions of hashes per second.
     *
     * GPUs are excellent at parallel CPU operations, but they don‚Äôt have much memory per core.
     *
     * A memory-hard algorithm forces each hashing operation to use a significant amount of RAM.
     *
     * This makes it much harder (and more expensive) to scale attacks on GPUs/ASICs, because memory becomes the bottleneck.]
     *
     * When to use:
     *
     * General-purpose web apps.
     *
     * You need a balance of security and performance.
     *
     * Great default if you don‚Äôt have strict compliance requirements.
     *
     *
     * 2. Argon2PasswordEncoder
     *
     * Algorithm: Argon2id (winner of the Password Hashing Competition).
     *
     * Strengths:
     *
     * Memory-hard ‚Üí resistant to GPU/ASIC cracking.()
     *
     * Tunable parameters: iterations (time), memory cost, parallelism.
     *
     * Future-proof, recommended in modern cryptography.
     *
     * Weaknesses:
     *
     * Slightly heavier on memory/CPU vs. BCrypt.
     *
     * When to use:
     *
     * Security-critical apps (finance, healthcare, government).
     *
     * New applications where you can enforce Argon2 from day one.
     *
     * If you want top-tier password hashing.
     *
     *
     * 3. PBKDF2PasswordEncoder
     *
     * Algorithm: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2).
     *
     * Strengths:
     *
     * Industry standard (NIST, PKCS #5).
     *
     * Configurable iterations and key length.
     *
     * Easy to get FIPS 140-2 compliance (important in enterprise/government).
     *
     * Weaknesses:
     *
     * CPU-bound (weaker against GPU attacks than Argon2/scrypt).
     *
     * When to use:
     *
     * Enterprise/government environments requiring NIST compliance.
     *
     * Interoperability with other systems already using PBKDF2.
     *
     * 4. SCryptPasswordEncoder
     *
     * Algorithm: scrypt.
     *
     * Strengths:
     *
     * Memory-hard like Argon2 (harder to brute force with hardware).
     *
     * Adjustable cost parameters.
     *
     * Weaknesses:
     *
     * Less popular than Argon2, fewer libraries/tools support it.
     *
     * When to use:
     *
     * When you want memory-hard protection but don‚Äôt want Argon2.
     *
     * Legacy systems already using scrypt.
     *
     *
     * 5. NoOpPasswordEncoder (‚ö†Ô∏è Not Secure)
     *
     * Algorithm: None (plain text).
     *
     * When to use:
     *
     * Only for testing/demo environments.
     *
     * üö´ Never use in production.
